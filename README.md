### 🐈 About this project 🐈

StuPamDous is a tongue-in-cheek website that celebrates two very special cats, Stu and Pam. These beloved cats reside with a good friend of mine, who has a contagious habit of cataloguing and reciting an ever-growing list of *stupendous* puns related to her cats' names. One day I shared my progress in teaching myself web development, and my friend offhandedly joked about using her cats as inspiration for my next project. Taking her suggestion in earnest, I thought to myself how much fun it would be to manifest her mental list of cat puns into reality. So Rabia, [this website](https://stupamdous.com/) is for you, and Happy Birthday!

### 🐱 Purpose 🐱
Before embarking on this project, I had never built anything (without the help of a tutorial) using pure JavaScript. Being incredibly new to web development, I only felt comfortable writing in HTML and CSS. I even felt more comfortable using jQuery's syntax and opted to use jQuery in lieu of JavaScript for a different project. Understanding that JavaScript fluency is fundamental to web development, I used this personal project as my incentive to learn a language that, in all truthfulness, scared me. Completing this project and making strides in grasping the basics of JavaScript gave me the confidence I needed to continue to write more programs in vanilla JavaScript without relying on simple-to-use, but heavy-duty JavaScript frameworks.

### 😼 How it works 😼
Hopefully self-explanatory, but you can visit [`stupamdous.com`](https://stupamdous.com/) to peruse through a list of pre-existing cat name puns. Or you can submit your own Stu- and/or Pam-related pun in the input field. If your submission successfully goes through, you will be rewarded with an adorable surprise gif.

**Input field rules:** submissions must contain a string between 0 and 50 characters and include the name Stu or Pam. 

**Input field restrictions:** submissions cannot contain any gibberish ("`pam laskjdfkj`"; "`qqqstu`") or ***only*** the names by themselves ("`stu`", "`pam`").

### 😾 Limitations 😾
This website does not save and upload user submissions on a database for other users to retrieve. I've thought a lot about the possibility of including this feature, but ultimately decided against it for the sake of quality control. Since non-pun submissions such as `Hey Stu!`, `Stu!!`, `Pammm`, or `Pam the Cat` can surpass the input field filters, I'd prefer to maintain an ongoing list of preset puns. Maybe in the future I will set up a system for user submissions to be eligible for administrator approval, but I'm not quite sure how to implement that yet. Any recommendations on how to proceed are highly welcome! Please contact me at crystal.agoncillo@gmail.com.
